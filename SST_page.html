							        <!--The ocean covers more than two-thirds of the earth's surface, and sea surface temperature (SST)
							        is crucial for monitoring climate state, understanding climate variability, and predicting climate changes.-->

											Sea-surface temperature (SST), typically defined at a depth of 20--30 cm of the ocean,
											is a crucial quantity for studying the earth's climate.  Estimates of historical SSTs to an accuracy of 0.05°C at the global scale
											and 0.1°C at regional scales are required for a wide range of climate applications,
											which include depicting past climate change, attributing anthropogenic versus internal
											climate variability, and understanding changes in climate and weather events that have
											far-reaching societal impacts, such as El Nino and hurricanes.
										</p>

										<p>
											Existing SST products based on in-situ instrumental observations,
							        such as HadSSTs and ERSSTs, are all based on the
							        International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (<a href="https://icoads.noaa.gov">ICOADS</a>).
							        Before the large-scale deployment of buoys and drifters in the 1980s, SSTs compiled under the ICOADS were sampled using
							        a variety of crude methods, such as buckets and engine-room intakes, by nonexpert sailors when they traveled across the ocean.

											 How to measure SSTs with a bucket? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmL95EXu1-U"><b>Ocean Weather Ship Record B (1947)</b></a> from <i>Youtube</i>
										</center>
										</p>

										<p>
											These ship-based SSTs are full of biases and errors.
											For example, bucket measurements can be biased cold from wind evaporations or biased warm from solar heating.
											When averaged over seasons and the globe, bucket SSTs are estimated to be coldly biased by several tenths of degrees Celsius (Folland & Parker, 1995).
											The bias of individual bucket SSTs can be as large as ± 1°C under extreme winter and summer conditions (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2011).
											On the other hand, ERI SSTs are estimated to be biased warm from 0.1 to 0.3°C due to the heat released from ship engines (Kennedy et al., 2011).
											Taking into account that the estimated global warming in the 20th century is less than 1°C,
											correcting for these biases appears to be crucial.
								    </p>

										<p>
											Yet accurate accounting for biases in ship-based SSTs is not easy because biases depend
											not only on measurement methods but also instrument designs (e.g., types of buckets), measurement protocols, and postprocessing practices.
											For example, water temperature in a less-insulated canvas bucket can be additionally cooler than that in a wooden bucket by
											more than 0.5°C even measured under the same condition (Folland & Parker, 1995).  In addition, buckets that stay on ship decks longer before measurements are taken
											will generally yield colder SSTs due to increased aerial exposure.  As a result, biases of different subsets of SSTs coming from the same method
											can be distinct from one another.
											<!--Misclassified method metadata, for example, misclassying ERI measurements to be bucket SSTs,
											will also lead to incorrect-->
										</p>

										<p>
											However, limited metadata to constrain detailed measurement characteristics have necessitated
											simplified corrections in existing SST products.  Existing corrections are often performed to the level of measurement methods,
											assuming that	SSTs coming from the same method are biased in the same way.
											These corrections often use fixed patterns and slow-varying amplitudes to represent SST biases,
											which inevitably leads to insufficient corrections, especially at regional scales.

										<h2><B style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Our work on correcting SST biases</B></h2>

										<p>
											Our goal is to achieve refined regional SST corrections.  Regional biases can arise from
											distinct biases associated with different subsets of SSTs and varying sampling coverage of these subsets.
											On account that ships from the same nation and data-collecting group would have used similar instruments,
											followed similar protocols, and experienced similar postprocessing practices,
											we correct SSTs for individual groups assigned by nation and ICOADS deck numbers, where the "deck" is
											the primary field to track ICOADS data collection and postprocessing.

												indicating the dominating role of anthropogenic activities, compared with natural variability,

											In <a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/osf.io/ju26e">Chan and Huybers (2020b)</a>,
											we apply the LME method to intercompare all available ship-based SSTs in ICOADS and quantify warm offsets in U.S. and U.K. Naval ships during WWII.
											We also identify a significant warm anomaly in nighttime bucket SSTs during the war, possibly related to reading temperatures inside ships to avoid detection. Accounting for groupwise offsets more fully removes data heterogeneity and leads to the removal of a warm spike during WWII seen in ERSST5 and HadSST4. Our groupwise correction makes SSTs during WWII to agree with coastal and island station temperatures, as well as the range of internal variability in CMIP5 models.
